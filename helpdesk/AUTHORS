django-helpdesk was originally written by Ross Poulton. After nearly nine
years under his guidance, the project graduated to its own eponymous
organization, and is currently maintained by:

Alex Seeholzer (@flinz)
Garret Wassermann (@gwasser)
Jonathan Barratt (@reduxionist)

Since publishing the code a number of people have made some fantastic
improvements and provided bug fixes and updates as the Django codebase
has moved on and caused small portions of this application to break.

To these people, and many more, our sincere thanks:

Alex Barcelo
Andreas Kotowicz
Chris Etcp
Daryl Egarr
